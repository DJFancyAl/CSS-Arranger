# CSS-Arranger

## Purpose

If you've every worked on a large web project, requiring a lot of CSS, then you understand how dizzying your CSS stylesheets can become. You have elements, classes, IDs, and more that have been styled. Most of the time this will not effect the way your site or app runs. However, it can create a lot of headaches when developing, troubleshooting, or reviewing your code.

To solve this problem we have the simple __"CSS Arranger"__. This script will take your existing stylesheet and reformat it so that items are sequenced based on their type and alphabetically. So instead of having a chaotic CSS file you will have one with a clean and repeatable structure like this:

1. __IDs__

    * Element with ID = A
    * Element with ID = B
    * Element with ID = C
    
2. __Classes__

    * Element with Class = A
    * Element with Class = B
    * Element with Class = C

3. __Other Elements__

    * Element Name = A
    * Element Name = B
    * Element Name = C

Ahhhh...isn't that much neater and more organized?
